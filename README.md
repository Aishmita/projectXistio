# project X istio
Project X for BlackRock Internship

# Problem Description :


Create a microservice architecture based application to identify the technical challenges involved in its deployment. Use Istio service
mesh framework and demonstrate how it helps to overcome these challenges.

Develop a simple UI where the user can choose a stock ticker. Create two microservices, one service connects to Google finance to pull
stock quotes while the other connects to Yahoo finance or any service alike. Create a third intermediate service that communicates with these two services. The UI will communicate only with this third service to display the stock information.

You need to use Istio framework as the service mesh and demonstrate some of its capabilities such as Traffic Management (like Ingress,
Egress, fault injection), Policies (Rate limits, blacklisting).

Feel free to add more microservices and features to the application if required to demonstrate the above capabilities
or additional Istio features. Use programming language(s) of your choice to develop the services.
